    - [ ] too much space between the header and the blog title
    - [ ] within a single post too much spacing between the headers h2 and their texts. also the texts and the next section header h2
    - [ ] the header should be wider (shameer and blog with mode change should extend to the screen size). the width of the blog content is actually correct.
    - [ ] the header changes width on each post and the / or /posts page. It should remain consistent always
    - [ ] the size of the icon for github, linkedin, twitter is big. It should be a consistent size (similiar to the sections. eg: `blog` at the header)
- header sections
    - [ ] currently theres only `blog`, add
        - [ ] about me
        - [ ] projects
- projects
    - [ ] create the projects page /projects similiar to https://www.joonie.dev/projects and keep a mock project for now
- individual blog
    - on mobile view or smaller devices there are a few issues
        - [ ] the title of blog is too big in this view.
        - [ ] the text contents of the blog do not wrap properly. The text overflows and I have to scroll a lot horizontally to read it. It does that cleanly for home page
